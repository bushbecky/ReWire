* Go learn Haskell if you haven't already; ReWire programs are Haskell programs of a certain form
* ReWire's special sauce
    - ReT and StT
    - Restrictions on recursion (data and control)
* How behavior maps to hardware
    - Data types map to bit vectors
    - One "signal" in ReT maps to one clock tick
